    This object represents a physical sample in the BEER simulator run.  There can be many samples, the data for
    which may be spread across many molecule/cluster packets.  Each packet includes a pointer to the sample from which
    the packet data is derived.  Samples derive from the basic input of the overall pipeline and are created by the

    packet and the cluster packet, it must be serializable.
